        <h3>14th of February</h3>
        <p>The 14th of February seems happy and harmless. Flowers and chocolates! Sappy notes and shameless rom-coms! Obligatory dinner dates. Candy hearts. Lots and lots of pink.
            But V-Day’s contemporary style is as far removed from its origins as your family’s Thanksgiving dinner is from your syphilis-sharing Pilgrim predecessors. Valentine’s Day is rooted in violence and loss. Brutality. Death. The punishment of the innocent. V-Day’s always had love notes and flowers. It’s just that they were written moments before slaughter and placed carefully next to a cracked skull and a fresh grave.
